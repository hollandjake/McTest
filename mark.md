### 5. Coverage Level Computation and Reporting

__Comments:__ Reports condition coverage only as far as I can see, but report is
nicely formatted into a PDF.

__Mark:__ 60

### 6. Test Suite Output

__Comments:__ Full JUnit test suite output.

__Mark:__ 100

### 7. GitHub Repo and README.md

__Comments:__ Good – includes Wiki and instructions. Could have been clearer
that it needed Java 8 (only noticed this in the pom.xml file), as it would not
work without me forcing a downgrade on my system. Good set of accompanying tests
and example code.

### Summary

A very nice attempt at the project. I'd have liked to have seen more focus on
different coverage types beyond plain condition coverage.
